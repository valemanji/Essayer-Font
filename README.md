# Essayer-Font
 Essayer, a french verb meaning to try, notes the experimental and DIY nature of my first font. This font was inspired by a Paul Rand Cover. Initially, I created part of it for a  cover page of the program for the 2019 Undergraduate Research Conference at Collin College, Plano, Tx. Recently, I decided to expand it to a proper font to learn how fonts are made.
